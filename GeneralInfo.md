:robot:





### Articles I have stolen ideas from:
  1. [Prerequisites for CI/CD article](http://renderedtext.com/blog/2012/11/12/prerequisites-for-continuous-integration/)
  2. Pretty cool article for "Olympics for Cloud-based CI/CD tools" [here](https://dzone.com/articles/olympics-of-top-5-cloud-ios-continuous-integration)
  3. [This Medium article](https://medium.com/xcblog/five-options-for-ios-continuous-delivery-without-fastlane-2a32e05ddf3d)
